# Welcome to Spice.ai

**Spice.ai** is a data and time-series AI application platform; an AI-backend-as-a-service comprising of composable, ready-to-use data and AI infrastructure pre-loaded with web3 data.

Spice.ai provides a set of building blocks for creating intelligent applications by bringing together real-time and historical time-series and Web3 data, custom ETL and compute, machine learning training and inferencing, through a community-centric developer experience, all in one place.

**Building and operating data and AI infrastructure is painful.**&#x20;

You have to:

* ðŸ˜“ build and operate archive node and data and AI infrastructure
* ðŸ˜“ understand and call JSON RPC APIs and smart-contract ABIs
* ðŸ˜“ manage 10s of TBs of data

**Spice.ai makes it easy.**

With **Spice.ai,** you can:

* query 100TB+ of real-time and historical data **using SQL** in seconds and fetch results in **JSON** or **Apache Arrow** for easy use with applications, ML, or libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
* collaborate on datasets, ML models, and applications in one place through the new community-centric developer hub.
* create, fork, and curate your own hosted datasets and ML models to share and build with the community.
* define and manage custom datasets in GitHub along with your application code.

Spice.ai is preloaded with community data from the **Ethereum**, **Bitcoin**, **Polygon,** and **EigenLayer** ecosystems along with enriched datasets for NFTs, DeFi, DEXs, ENS, Prices, and more. Most datasets are open-source and are available at [github.com/spiceai/datasets](https://github.com/spiceai/datasets).

Building blocks available in the Spice.ai platform today include:

* Cloud Data Platform preloaded with [Web3 Data](building-blocks/datasets.md)
* [Datasets and Views](building-blocks/datasets-and-views.md)
* [Spice Firecache](building-blocks/spice-firecache.md)
* [Spice Functions](building-blocks/spice-functions/)
* ML Models (in Preview)
* [AI Predictions](api/predictions/) (in Preview)
