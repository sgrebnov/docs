# Apps

**Apps** are self-contained sets of SQL, datasets, monitoring, and configuration that run on the Spice.xyz platform.

Each app has a unique API Key and can be owned individual accounts or [**organizations**](../../core-concepts/organizations.md).

### Learn how to:

* [Transfer an app to another organization](app-transfer.md)
* [Connect an app with your existing GitHub repository](link-github-repository-beta.md)
* [Create and toggle custom dataset and views (beta)](datasets-beta.md)
* [Build and run your Spice Functions](spice-functions/)
