# Connect GitHub repository

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Connecting your app to a GitHub repository is in beta for Design Partners. Get in touch for more info.
{% endhint %}

Connecting your Spice.xyz app to a GitHub repository allows you to create custom [Datasets and Views](datasets-beta.md), add datasets to Spice Firecache, author [Spice Functions](functions-beta.md), and train AI Models.

## Prerequisites

* Active Spice.xyz account
* Valid GitHub repository

## Prepare the repository

Before proceeding with the integration, ensure that you have the appropriate access and that the repository meets the following requirements:

* Admin Access: Make sure you have administrative access to the GitHub repository. This level of access is necessary to [establish the required connections](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/installing-a-github-app-from-github-marketplace-for-your-organizations#requirements-to-install-a-github-app-on-an-organization).
* Matching Owner and Repo Name: Verify that the following naming conventions are in place:
  * The owner of the GitHub repository should match the Spice organization name.
  * The repository name should match the Spice app name.

To quickly set up a new repository, [use our template](https://github.com/spiceai/spice-app-template) as a starting point:
