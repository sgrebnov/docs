# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Spice

**Spice** is a high-performance web3 data provider and platform for applications, machine learning (ML), and data science. It's built and supported by the team at [**Spice AI**](https://spice.ai).

**Obtaining blockchain and smart-contract data is hard**.

For data in a format and quantities that's useful, you have to:

* ðŸ˜“ build and operate archive node and data infrastructure
* ðŸ˜“ understand and call JSON RPC APIs and smart-contract ABIs
* ðŸ˜“ manage 10s of TBs of data

**Spice makes it easy.**

With **Spice,** you can query blockchain data **using SQL** in seconds and fetch results in **JSON** or **Apache Arrow** for easy use with apps, ML, or libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

Spice currently supports **Ethereum**, **Bitcoin**, and **Polygon** blockchain and contract data. We have plans to support many chains prioritized by user feedback. We expect to next support **Solana**.

In addition to supporting standard web3 **JSON RPC**, Spice provides querying for historical on-chain data available in both block-level and time-aggregated result sets.

Take it for a spin, and try out the [getting started guide](get-started/).
