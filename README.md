# Welcome to Spice

**Spice** is a high-performance web3 data provider and platform for applications, machine learning (ML), and data science. It's built and supported by the team at [**Spice AI**](https://spice.ai).

**Obtaining blockchain and smart-contract data is hard**.

For data in a format and quantities that's useful, you have to:

* ðŸ˜“ build and operate archive node and data infrastructure
* ðŸ˜“ understand and call JSON RPC APIs and smart-contract ABIs
* ðŸ˜“ manage 10s of TBs of data

**Spice makes it easy.**

With **Spice,** you can query real-time and historical blockchain data **using SQL** in seconds and fetch results in **JSON** or **Apache Arrow** for easy use with apps, ML, or libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

Spice currently supports **Ethereum**, **Bitcoin**, **Polygon,** and **Flow** blockchains along with datasets for NFTs, DeFi, DEXs, ENS, Prices, and more.

Spice also includes high-RPS hosted **RPC Nodes**.

Take it for a spin, and try out the [getting started guide](get-started/).
