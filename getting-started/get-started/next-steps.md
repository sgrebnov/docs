### Create a Custom Dataset&#x20;

Seamlessly integrate your Spice.xyz apps with [GitHub repositories](../../portal/apps/link-github-repository-beta.md) to setup up [custom datasets ](../../portal/apps/datasets-beta.md)and [functions](../../portal/apps/functions-beta.md).

### **Next steps**

To get inspired and learn more about leveraging queries, SDKs, and APIs for different tasks:

* Read the [Apps](../../portal/apps/) Guide.&#x20;
* Explore our library of [SQL Reference](../../reference/sql-reference/), [Query Tables](../../reference/sql-query-tables/), and [Sample Queries](../../reference/example-ethereum-sql-queries/).&#x20;
* Start experimenting in the [Playground](https://spice.xyz/login).&#x20;
* Keep the in mind [Best Practices](../best-practices.md) as you start building.
